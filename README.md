##Introduction

This project involves creating an API for a film review aggregation platform, which incorporates a comprehensive movie database. Users can leave reviews with star ratings on films they have seen and curate lists of films based around any theme of their choosing. Additionally, they have the capability to explore movies by genre, director, and other relevant criteria.

The motivation behind this project is to foster a dynamic and engaging platform where users can interact with films in a meaningful and personalized manner. This project have been created as part of BNTA (Bright Network Technology Academy) Cohort 13 Group 3 Collaboration Backend Project.

## MVP

Design and build an API with CRUD functionality. There will be a one-to-many relationship of Movies  and Users to the Reviews.

- Delete review

- Get all users
- Get specific user
- Get all reviews by a specific user
- Get all movie lists by specific user
- Create a user
- Delete a user
