## Introduction

This project involves creating an API for a film review aggregation platform, which incorporates a comprehensive movie database. Users can leave reviews with star ratings on films they have seen and curate lists of films based around any theme of their choosing. Additionally, they have the capability to explore movies by genre, director, and other relevant criteria.

The motivation behind this project is to foster a dynamic and engaging platform where users can interact with films in a meaningful and personalized manner. This project have been created as part of BNTA (Bright Network Technology Academy) Cohort 13 Group 3 Collaboration Backend Project.

## MVP

Design and build an API with CRUD functionality. There will be a one-to-many relationship of Movies  and Users to the Reviews.

The API must include routes enabling user to:

- View all movies
- Get movie by id
- Add movie
- Edit movie
- Get all the reviews of a movie

- Create review
- Edit review
- Delete review

- Get all users
- Get specific user
- Get all reviews by a specific user
- Get all movie lists by specific user
- Create a user
- Delete a user
  
- Get all movie lists
- Get specific movie list by id
- Create movie list
- Update movie list
- Delete movie list

<a id="extension"></a>
## EXTENSION:
- Movie has a duration property
- User can filter movie search by duration

- Give movies an average rating property
- Filter movies by average rating
- Round average rating to 2dp

- Edit a userâ€™s information
- User can set lists to private or public
- Display lists containing a specific film

- Automatically add current date to review (refactor to LocalDateTime)
- Order movies reviews by oldest/newest created
- Order user reviews by oldest/newest created

- Allow movies to have multiple genres
- Allow users to leave comments and likes on reviews
- User is able to toggle their movie list to public or private
- The get movielist request only shows public movielists (when a user searches for their movielists they can still see their private ones though)
