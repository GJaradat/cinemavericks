**MVP:**

Design and build an API with CRUD functionality. There will be a one-to-many relationship of Movies  and Users to the Reviews.

The Movie table will have columns for:

- Genre
- Director

The User table will have columns for:
- Id

The Review table will have columns for:
- id 
- Title

The API must include routes enabling user to:

Create a list of movies

- Edit movie
- View all movies
- Get movie by id
- Get all the reviews of a movie
- Get all movie lists
- Get specific movie list by id
- Create movie list
- Update movie list
- Delete movie list
- Create review
- Edit review
- Delete review
- Get all users
- Get specific user
- Get all reviews by a specific user
- Get all lists by specific user
- Create a user
- Delete a user

Create a DataLoader to seed the database with Users, Movies and Reviews.

**EXTENSION:**
- User can set lists to private or public
- Edit a userâ€™s information
- Display average rating of movie
- Filter movies by rating
- Display lists containing a specific film
- Allow movies to have multiple genres
- Automatically add current date to review (refactor to LocalDate)
